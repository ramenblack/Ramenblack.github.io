									<h3>HTML</h3>
									<p>Learning how to write and style HTML5 websites has been my greatest achievement in this classroom. I have learned to create modern and responsive web code, such as the one
									you are currently viewing.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>PHP</h3>
									<p>Another area in this class in which I have developed interest in PHP. I've used PHP to create advanced login pages and profiles, as well as comment boxes.</p>

							<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My personal satisfaction is helping my teammates to elevate our projects to the best they can possibly be.

							<h3>My skills and hobbies:</h3>
							<ul>
							<li>I'm greatly interested and experienced in photography, both film and digital.</li>
							<li>1+ years of guitar experience, and have performed publicly.</li>
							<li>Skilled public speaker, with lots of experience.</li>
							<li>Interested in art and graphic design.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>My Challenges In This Class:</h3>
							<ul>
							<li>Variable based languages such as Python and Java.</li>
							<li>It's hard to transfer work between home and classroom.</li>

							<h2>The Tritech Experience.</h2>
							<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tritech is a great opprotunity to get hands on technical experience in the field of your choosing. In Cyber Security, we got hands on right from the beginning,
							learning how to install debian, and the early stages of web development. Throughout my year here, I have had the opprotunity to become a skilled web designer, and make some friends along the way. 
							<br><br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tritech also presents a number of opprotunities to get internships, and jobs in the field. One example is the PNNL internship, as well as the fact
							that Tritech gives you training needed to get a job in Cyber Security.

							<h2>Plans For The Future.</h2>
		
						<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My plans for the future are to begin working this summer, to get job experience, and build up my resume. After I graduate highschool, I plan to start working fulltime, what kind of work is unclear, however I'd be content doing anything that puts food on the table. I also plan to be doing freelance photography and website jobs on the side.
							<br><br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ultimate goal in life is to move to Seattle, which I believe to be one of the best cities in the world. If not seattle, I'll move to Portland, which is slightly cheaper. I love big cities though, and want to live in one more than anything.
